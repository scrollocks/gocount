# Word Counter in Go
Some example programs that count words in text files.

## Requirements
There really aren't any. All you need to do is install Go (at least v1.8).
I've not created any packages or done anything else best-practicey, in the interests of things just working.

## Running the programs
To run wc_1.go, just execute `go run wc_1.go some_text.txt`.
